# Insurance_Claim_DS_Project
Insurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many countries it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!
Knowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the features that result in the best performing model so that they can better estimate consumer behavior and anticipate costs.
